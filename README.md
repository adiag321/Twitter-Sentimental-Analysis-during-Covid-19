# <p align = 'center'>Twitter Sentimental Analysis during Covid-19</p>

The coronavirus pandemic hit the worldwide population to a large extent. The economy of the
most secured nations plummeted, lives were lost and a larger portion of the population lost their
jobs. But one of the subtle effects of the covid pandemic is the depletion of the mental health of
the people. A person without a sound mental capacity resembles an animal wandering the roads
to find food. As responsible citizens and inhabitants of the world, we must contribute to
improving the mental health of those affected.

Our research is based on Twitter sentiment analysis. According to psychiatrists, 20% of the
people affected by the coronavirus developed mental illness within 90 days. Apart from this,
staying at home during the lockdown has depleted the mental health of the normal population.
Social media has become an efficient platform to express oneself. And Twitter is one of the most
used platforms. The project focuses on predicting depression in a person using his/her tweets.
The project employs the principles of Machine Learning, Deep Learning as well as Natural
language processing for developing the model to predict depression in individuals. The dataset
that is required to train the model was acquired using the Twitter API, Tweepy library in python,
and online hydrators were additionally employed to collect the tweets. Some of the prospective
models that we are aiming to implement during the course of the project are- RNN, BERT,
Transformer, and ELM.

Mental health is a sector of medical science that is subtle and can be cumbersome to predict. By
developing a model using the tweets of the individual, we hope that people having a mental
illness can be spotted easily and treated accordingly
